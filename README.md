## Rainier's Cluster Project using Zillow Data Set

### Goal:
Improve the original log error (zestimate) by using clustering methodologies

### Hypothesis:
- Noteable clusters will be based on location
- A model containing the clusters based on location will perform better than a model without clusters based on location
