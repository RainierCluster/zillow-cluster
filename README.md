## Rainier's Cluster Project using Zillow Data Set
##### Presented by Cris Giovanoni and Misty Garcia

### Goals
- Improve the zestimate "logerror" by using clustering methodologies
- Identify what is driving the difference in logerror to sales price
- Build a model to predict your target logerror

### Hypotheses
- Noteable clusters will be based on location
- A model containing the clusters based on location will perform better than a model without clusters based on location

### Components
- Use clustering
- Teach others
- Use statistical tests
- Visualize to explore
- Scale
- Impute
- Feature engineering
- Code resuseability/modularity
- Stages of pipeline

### Deliverables
- Notebook
- Supporting materials
- Present findings/learnings to class

### Required to run
- Access to the bayes sql database
- env.py file with host, username, and password

### How to reproduce
- Pull .py files
- Add personal env.py file
- Run through "Using Clustering to Reduce Log Error in the Zillow Dataset.ipynb" pipeline
- Random states of 123 are set in .py files
