## Rainier's Cluster Project using Zillow Data Set
#### Presented by: Cris and Misty

### Goals:
- Improve the original zestimate "logerror" by using clustering methodologies
- Identify what is driving the difference in logerror to sales price
- Build a model to predict your target logerror

### Hypothesis:
- Noteable clusters will be based on location
- A model containing the clusters based on location will perform better than a model without clusters based on location

### Components:
- Use clustering
- Teach others
- Use statistical tests
- Visualize to explore
- Scale
- Impute
- Feature engineering
- Code resuseability/modularity
- Stages of pipeline

### Deliverables: 
- Notebook
- Supporting materials
- Present findings/learnings to class
